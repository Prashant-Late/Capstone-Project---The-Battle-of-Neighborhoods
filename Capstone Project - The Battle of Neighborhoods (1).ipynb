Specifically, this report can provide a reference for stakeholders who are interested in opening a movie theater in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. \nIn this report, we will focus on all areas on the Montreal island. There are many movie theaters on Montreal island, we will conclude where are the existing movie theaters. Then we will use a clustering model to find similar areas on the island considering demographic data of each borough and region. The preferred area shall be distant from existing movie theaters.\nWe will use data science tools to fetch the raw data, visualize it then generate a few most promising areas based on the above criteria. In the meanwhile, we will also explain the advantage and traits for the candidates, so that stakeholders can make the final decision base on the analysis."
